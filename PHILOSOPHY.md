# Notes

_These are only notes!_

- NGN is not meant to be Rails. If you want to use Rails... use Rails.
- The hard part of building apps is not the structure. It's the entity modeling.
- The hard part of building systems is the infrastructure.
- NGN is designed to create your own distributed systems.
- The NGN "logic" API, which is really just models & function libraries, is designed to catalyze app development.
- NGN attempts to follow the 12-factor app approach... sorta.
- The NGN services, like proxy & mechanic, are designed to simplify management.
- When the OS can be used, it is. Daemons are native to the OS (no forever). Logs are native to
the OS, but still accessible for things like live streaming.
