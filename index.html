        <h3>NGN-JS: A node.js Application Engine</h3>
		<p>
			NGN provides aÂ boilerplate class structure and utilities for RAD (rapid application development).
			It can be used independently or as the foundation for a larger library. 
		</p>
		<p>
			NGN was inspired by ColdFusion (yes, really) & Rails, but differs in many ways. ColdFusion has gone through several iterations. Originally
			it sat on top of C++ and masked a lot of the boilerplate stuff you'd have to write in C++. Then it did the same for Java.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Along the way, ColdFusion added a lot of simple features that make application development focused more on application logic
			than programming constructs. All the while, it never restricted access to the underlying JVM, making it a tool beginners and advanced
			developers could use together.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Rails took this concept to a whole different level, and did it with an old language like Ruby. While NGN is not Rails or ColdFusion,
			many of it's elements are influenced by the approaches of these languages/frameworks.
		</p>

		<p>This is very much in pre-alpha. There are a number of features, but they need testing.</p>
