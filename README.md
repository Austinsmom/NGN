LICENSE
=======

GPL (for now).

At the moment, I'm reserving a number of rights until the shape of the work becomes a little more apparent.
There will definitely be an open license. Which one I switch to is still in the air. There may be a second
commerical license (i.e. dual licensing) if commercial backing is required to keep the project going.
